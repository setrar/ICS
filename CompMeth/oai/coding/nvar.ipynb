    "The variable `nvar` in the provided code is used to accumulate the noise variance for each antenna and each layer during the channel estimation process. The noise variance provides a measure of the noise power in the received signal and is important for various signal processing tasks, such as demodulation and decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed explanation of how `nvar` is used in the provided code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the channel estimation process, `nvar` is initialized to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int nest_count = 0;\n",
    "uint64_t noise_amp2 = 0;\n",
    "c16_t ul_ls_est[symbolSize] __attribute__((aligned(32)));\n",
    "memset(ul_ls_est, 0, sizeof(c16_t) * symbolSize);\n",
    "delay_t *delay = &gNB->ulsch[ul_id].delay;\n",
    "memset(delay, 0, sizeof(*delay));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation and Accumulation of Noise Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise variance is calculated as part of the channel estimation process. Specifically, after the least squares (LS) estimation and delay compensation, the code calculates the difference between the initial LS estimates and the interpolated channel estimates. The noise variance is updated by accumulating the squared magnitude of these differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For DMRS Type 1 with Frequency-Domain Interpolation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "for (int n = 0; n < 3 * nb_rb_pusch; n++) {\n",
    "    for (int k_line = 0; k_line <= 1; k_line++) {\n",
    "        int k = pilot_cnt << 1;\n",
    "        ul_ch[k] = c16mulShift(ul_ch[k], ul_inv_delay_table[k], 8);\n",
    "        ul_ch[k + 1] = c16mulShift(ul_ch[k + 1], ul_inv_delay_table[k + 1], 8);\n",
    "        noise_amp2 += c16amp2(c16sub(ul_ls_est[k], ul_ch[k]));\n",
    "        noise_amp2 += c16amp2(c16sub(ul_ls_est[k + 1], ul_ch[k + 1]));\n",
    "        pilot_cnt++;\n",
    "        nest_count += 2;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `noise_amp2` accumulates the squared magnitude of the difference between the initial LS estimates (`ul_ls_est`) and the compensated/interpolated channel estimates (`ul_ch`). The `c16sub` function calculates the difference, and `c16amp2` computes the squared magnitude of this difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For DMRS Type 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "for (int n = 0; n < nb_rb_pusch * NR_NB_SC_PER_RB; n += 6) {\n",
    "    c16_t ch0 = c16mulShift(*pil, rx[(k0 + n) % symbolSize], 15);\n",
    "    pil++;\n",
    "    c16_t ch1 = c16mulShift(*pil, rx[(k0 + n + 1) % symbolSize], 15);\n",
    "    pil++;\n",
    "    c16_t ch = c16addShift(ch0, ch1, 1);\n",
    "    *max_ch = max(*max_ch, max(abs(ch.r), abs(ch.i)));\n",
    "    multadd_real_four_symbols_vector_complex_scalar(filt8_rep4, &ch, &ul_ls_est[n]);\n",
    "    ul_ls_est[n + 4] = ch;\n",
    "    ul_ls_est[n + 5] = ch;\n",
    "    noise_amp2 += c16amp2(c16sub(ch0, ch));\n",
    "    nest_count++;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the noise variance is updated similarly, but it happens within a different context specific to DMRS type 2 processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Calculation of Noise Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "After processing all antennas and layers, the accumulated noise variance (`noise_amp2`) is averaged by dividing by the total number of noise samples (`nest_count`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "if (nvar && nest_count > 0) {\n",
    "    *nvar = (uint32_t)(noise_amp2 / nest_count);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line ensures that `nvar` contains the average noise variance across all processed samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of `nvar` Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: `nvar` is initialized to zero before the channel estimation begins.\n",
    "2. **Noise Calculation**: During channel estimation, the noise variance is calculated as the squared magnitude of the difference between the initial LS estimates and the interpolated channel estimates.\n",
    "3. **Accumulation**: The calculated noise variance is accumulated in the variable `noise_amp2`.\n",
    "4. **Averaging**: After processing all antennas and layers, the accumulated noise variance is averaged by dividing by the total number of noise samples (`nest_count`).\n",
    "5. **Output**: The final averaged noise variance is assigned to `nvar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise variance (`nvar`) is crucial for further processing steps, such as demodulation and decoding, where knowledge of the noise power helps in making better decisions regarding the received signal."
