Hello future cloud architects,

As promised, your Azure assignments are out. On Moodle, you will find the tasks to carry out and you will also find the deliverable document you need to submit. There are two labs, each of which has a series of subtasks. As mentioned in the class, you will be using Azure Learn and also the azuremol book which has been uploaded to Moodle also for your convenience. 

Deadline: You are expected to turn in both assignments by January 12. **THIS IS A HARD DEADLINE. SUBMISSIONS AFTER THIS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.** 

**Note-1**: When you sign up for the free Azure account, make sure you get the "Azure for students" subscription (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/). This student account will give you 100$ credit for a whole year. So make sure you get it.

**Note-2**: You might have to sign up with a personal email address first and then use the EURECOM one for student verification to get the student account.
 
**Note-3**: Make sure you use a git server to save your code. At EURECOM, we have gitlab.eurecom.fr. I highly recommend using this over public ones.
 
**Note-4**: Track your budget on Azure and make sure you do shutdown VMs and free up high-performance storage.
 
**Note-5**: After finishing each part of the lab, shutdown all services and free up unused resources. Before you submit your deliverable on 12th, turn on the services, get the URL, and put it in the deliverable document. On 13th, we will check the URLs and get back to you. Then you can delete everything.
 
If you run into any problems, let me know.
 
Best of luck,
Raja
