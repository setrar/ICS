    "### **Standard SSD (`/dev/sdb`):**\n",
    "1. **Sequencing Bandwidth (196 MiB/s):**  \n",
    "   - This indicates the disk's performance when reading/writing large blocks of data sequentially. \n",
    "   - The measured value of **196 MiB/s** is typical for a Standard SSD, as sequential operations leverage the SSD's design for high throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random IOPS (3,128):**  \n",
    "   - **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)** measures the performance of small, random read/write operations (4 KB blocks). \n",
    "   - A higher IOPS value reflects the disk's ability to handle small, frequent operations efficiently.\n",
    "   - The value of **3,128 IOPS** aligns with the Standard SSD's performance for workloads with random access patterns (e.g., database queries).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Premium SSD (`/dev/sdc`):**\n",
    "1. **Sequencing Bandwidth (26.3 MiB/s):**  \n",
    "   - Surprisingly lower than expected for a Premium SSD. This might indicate:\n",
    "     - Misconfiguration in the disk or VM.\n",
    "     - Bottlenecks such as network bandwidth limits (if the disk is remotely managed).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random IOPS (421):**  \n",
    "   - The random IOPS measured is significantly below Azure's advertised range for Premium SSDs, which typically exceed 5,000 IOPS for this size. This low value may again reflect:\n",
    "     - Incorrect caching or mounting settings.\n",
    "     - Throttling due to VM configuration or tier mismatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Possible Discrepancies to Investigate:**\n",
    "- Confirm the disk types using Azure CLI or other tools (`az disk show`).\n",
    "- Ensure the disks are attached with proper configurations (e.g., Premium SSDs benefit from `ReadWrite` caching).\n",
    "- Review the VM size to confirm it supports the performance expected for these disk types.\n",
    "- Rerun tests with adjusted parameters, such as `numjobs`, `iodepth`, and block sizes (`bs`) to ensure realistic workloads.\n",
