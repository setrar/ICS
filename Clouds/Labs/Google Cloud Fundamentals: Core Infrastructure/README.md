Hello future cloud architects, 

 Due to an unexpected turn of events, I have to attend a full day meeting tomorrow. Given this, I have decided to turn tomorrow's lecture into a lab session.

I need all of you to sign up for Google Cloud Skills Boost following the instructions here: https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/googlecloud-careerlaunchpad-student-guide.pdf.

IMPORTANT: USE YOUR OFFICIAL EURECOM EMAIL ADDRESS THAT IS USED FOR THE COURSE REGISTRATION. YOU CAN FIND YOUR EMAIL HERE: https://nextcloud.eurecom.fr/s/gQBbzsxTqrcyANR. IT IS THIS EMAIL YOU MUST USE TO SIGN UP.

Please make sure you use the correct email address to sign up for GCSB account BEFORE 1PM tomorrow. 

At 1.30PM, I will send an invitation to your email addresses and add you to the Google Cloud Engineering Certificate learning path.

Tomorrow, you will start the learning path by doing week 1 of the learning path which is the course "Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure". Remember, to get the lab grades, you will have to complete the full course including quizzes and demo labs.

Good luck and happy learning,

Raja
