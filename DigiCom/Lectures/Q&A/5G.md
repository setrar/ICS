## &#xFFFFF; How the SSB is divided in 240 subcarriers in the time domain and 20 ressources blocks in the frequency domain


In the context of 5G NR (New Radio), a Single Sideband (SSB) signal is typically divided into subcarriers in the time domain and resources blocks in the frequency domain. The division is part of the overall framework for resource allocation and modulation in 5G.

Here's a brief explanation of how the SSB is divided into subcarriers in the time domain and resource blocks in the frequency domain:

1. **Time Domain (Subcarriers):**
   - In the time domain, the SSB is divided into subcarriers, which are essentially symbols that carry information. Each subcarrier represents a discrete unit of time in which data can be transmitted.
   - The time-domain structure is organized into slots and frames. A slot is a time interval within a subframe, and a frame is a collection of multiple subframes.
   - The SSB is transmitted over a certain number of slots and frames, and subcarriers within these slots carry the information.

2. **Frequency Domain (Resource Blocks):**
   - In the frequency domain, the SSB is divided into resource blocks. A resource block is a contiguous set of subcarriers in the frequency domain.
   - Each resource block consists of a certain number of subcarriers (for example, 12 subcarriers in the case of 5G NR).
   - Resource blocks are the basic units for frequency-domain scheduling and allocation. They are used for assigning frequency resources to different users, services, or signaling.

The specific details of the time and frequency division depend on the 5G NR numerology, which defines the subcarrier spacing, slot duration, and other parameters.

For example, in 5G NR, the carrier bandwidth is divided into frequency chunks called numerology. Each numerology has its own subcarrier spacing, and the SSB is structured based on these numerologies. The resource blocks within each numerology follow the specified subcarrier spacing.

In summary, the division of the SSB into subcarriers in the time domain and resource blocks in the frequency domain is part of the framework for organizing and transmitting data in 5G NR. The exact parameters and organization depend on the specific configuration and numerology used in a particular 5G deployment.


## &#xFFFFF; Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)

In 5G and other wireless communication systems that use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), subcarriers play a crucial role in transmitting data. OFDM is a modulation technique that divides the available spectrum into multiple subcarriers, each carrying a part of the overall data signal. These subcarriers are orthogonal, meaning they are designed to be mutually exclusive to minimize interference.

In the context of 5G, the use of subcarriers helps achieve several goals:

1. **Efficient Spectrum Utilization:** OFDM allows the transmission of multiple data streams simultaneously by dividing the available spectrum into numerous subcarriers. This enables efficient use of the frequency spectrum and enhances data throughput.

2. **Mitigation of Frequency Selective Fading:** The use of multiple subcarriers helps combat the effects of frequency-selective fading, where certain frequencies experience more significant attenuation than others. Since the data is distributed across multiple subcarriers, the impact of fading on the overall signal is reduced.

3. **Flexibility in Resource Allocation:** 5G networks are designed to be flexible and adaptive, dynamically allocating resources based on the communication requirements. Subcarriers can be assigned and managed according to the specific needs of different users and applications.

4. **Support for Multiple Antennas (MIMO):** Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is a key technology in 5G, enabling the use of multiple antennas for improved data rates and link reliability. Subcarriers can be spatially separated and assigned to different antennas, facilitating the implementation of MIMO.

In summary, subcarriers in 5G, as part of the OFDM modulation scheme, contribute to the efficient use of the frequency spectrum, enhance data throughput, and provide flexibility in resource allocation to meet the diverse requirements of different communication scenarios.
