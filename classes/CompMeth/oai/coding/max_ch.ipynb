    "In the provided code, the `max_ch` variable is used to track the maximum channel amplitude encountered during the channel estimation process for a given antenna (denoted by `aarx`). The `max_ch` value is updated during the channel estimation process to reflect the largest channel gain seen across different Resource Elements (REs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed explanation of how `max_ch` is updated and what it signifies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of `max_ch`\n",
    "\n",
    "`max_ch` is intended to hold the maximum absolute value of the channel estimates for a specific antenna. This information is useful for scaling and normalizing the channel estimates, as well as for potential debugging and performance monitoring purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How `max_ch` is Updated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - `max_ch` is initially set to 0 or to an appropriate initial value before starting the channel estimation loop for each antenna.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linear Least Squares (LS) Estimation**:\n",
    "   - The LS estimation process computes the channel estimate (`ch`) for each subcarrier (RE) based on the received DMRS (Demodulation Reference Signal) and the known transmitted DMRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Finding Maximum Channel Gain**:\n",
    "   - For each estimated channel coefficient, the absolute value of the real and imaginary parts of the channel estimate are compared to the current `max_ch` value.\n",
    "   - If the current channel coefficient has a larger amplitude than the current `max_ch`, `max_ch` is updated to this new larger value.\n",
    "   - This comparison and potential update occur in several places in the code where channel estimates are computed or updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Snippets and Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization**:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "c16_t *rxdataF = (c16_t *)&gNB->common_vars.rxdataF[aarx][symbol_offset];\n",

    "memset(ul_ch, 0, sizeof(*ul_ch) * symbolSize);\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Here, `rxdataF` points to the received frequency domain signal for the specific antenna.\n",
    "- `ul_ch` points to the buffer where the channel estimates will be stored.\n",
    "- The channel estimate buffer is initialized to zero.\n",

    "- In this loop, `ch` is the channel estimate for a particular RE.\n",
    "- The channel estimate is computed using the `c32x16maddShift` function, which likely performs a multiply-accumulate operation.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_ch` is used to keep track of the maximum amplitude of the channel estimates for a given antenna.\n",
    "- It is updated by comparing the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts of each computed channel estimate to the current `max_ch` value.\n",
    "- This update ensures that `max_ch` always reflects the highest channel gain observed, which can be useful for normalizing the channel estimates and for performance monitoring.\n",
    "- The code handles different DMRS configuration types (type 1 and type 2) and performs delay compensation and frequency-domain interpolation as part of the channel estimation process."
