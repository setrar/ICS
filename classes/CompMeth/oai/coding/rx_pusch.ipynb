    "### Usage of `nr_pusch_channel_estimation`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nr_pusch_channel_estimation` function is called with the following parameters:\n",
    "- **gNB**: A pointer to the gNB (gNodeB) structure, which contains all the necessary context and parameters for the NR (New Radio) base station.\n",
    "- **slot**: The slot number within the frame.\n",
    "- **nl**: The current layer index.\n",
    "- **get_dmrs_port(nl, rel15_ul->dmrs_ports)**: The DMRS (Demodulation Reference Signal) port number for the current layer.\n",
    "- **symbol**: The current symbol index within the slot.\n",
    "- **ulsch_id**: The identifier for the ULSCH (Uplink Shared Channel) process.\n",
    "- **bwp_start_subcarrier**: The starting subcarrier index for the BWP.\n",
    "- **rel15_ul**: A pointer to the PUSCH PDU (Protocol Data Unit) structure, containing all the PUSCH-specific parameters.\n",
    "- **&max_ch**: A pointer to an integer where the maximum channel value will be stored.\n",
    "- **&nvar_tmp**: A pointer to a variable where the noise variance for the current estimation will be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breakdown of `nr_pusch_channel_estimation` Role\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Channel Estimation**:\n",
    "   - The function performs channel estimation for the given symbol and layer using the received DMRS signals.\n",
    "   - It estimates the channel response between the transmitter (UE) and receiver (gNB) for each antenna.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Update `max_ch`**:\n",
    "   - During the channel estimation process, the function updates `max_ch` to reflect the maximum channel gain observed. This is useful for normalizing the channel estimates and ensuring the dynamic range is handled appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Noise Variance Calculation (`nvar_tmp`)**:\n",
    "   - The function calculates the noise variance (`nvar_tmp`) for the current symbol and layer. This provides a measure of the noise power in the received signal, which is important for SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) estimation and subsequent decoding steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Accumulation of Noise Variance**:\n",
    "   - After each call to `nr_pusch_channel_estimation`, the accumulated noise variance (`nvar_tmp`) is added to a running total (`nvar`).\n",
    "   - This total is later averaged to obtain the overall noise variance for the entire PUSCH transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loop over Symbols**:\n",
    "   - For each symbol in the PUSCH transmission, check if it contains DMRS.\n",
    "   - If it does, proceed with channel estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop over Layers**:\n",
    "   - For each layer, call `nr_pusch_channel_estimation` to perform the actual channel estimation and noise variance calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Variables**:\n",
    "   - Update `max_ch` with the maximum channel gain observed.\n",
    "   - Accumulate `nvar_tmp` into `nvar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Averaging Noise Variance**:\n",
    "   - After the loops, average the accumulated noise variance (`nvar`) over the number of symbols, layers, and antennas.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `nr_pusch_channel_estimation` in this way, the function `nr_rx_pusch_tp` ensures that channel estimates are accurately computed for each symbol and layer, and that noise variance is properly accounted for, which are crucial for reliable decoding of the PUSCH."
