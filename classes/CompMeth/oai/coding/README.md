```

The output of the command `sudo cmake_targets/build_oai --phy_simulators` indicates the following steps and outcomes:

1. **Compilation Start**: The command initiates the build process for OpenAirInterface (OAI) physical layer simulators. The user `bricer` is prompted for their password to execute the command with `sudo` privileges.
   
2. **CMake Configuration**:
   - The script identifies the directory for OpenAirInterface (`OPENAIR_DIR = /home/bricer/Developer/openairinterface5g`).
   - It runs the CMake configuration command (`cmake3 ../../..`).
   - It finds `ccache` and confirms that CMake version is 3.4 or higher.
   - Several checks are performed to verify the capabilities of the ASN.1 compiler (`/opt/asn1c/bin/asn1c`).
   - The build type is set to `RelWithDebInfo`, which is a build with optimizations and debug information.
   - The CPU architecture is identified as `x86_64`, and AVX512 and AVX2 intrinsics are enabled.
   - The versions for E2AP and KPM are selected as `E2AP_V2` and `KPM_V2_03` respectively.
   - LTTNG (Linux Tracing Toolkit Next Generation) support is disabled.
   - The script checks for the `libcap` module but does not find it (`Package 'libcap', required by 'virtual:world', not found`).
   - Documentation with Doxygen is not requested, and support for aerial features is not included.
   - The CMake configuration process completes successfully, generating build files in `/home/bricer/Developer/openairinterface5g/cmake_targets/ran_build/build`.

3. **Build Execution**:
   - The build directory is changed to `/home/bricer/Developer/openairinterface5g/cmake_targets/ran_build/build`.
   - The build command is executed (`cmake3 --build .  --target ... -- -j28`), specifying several targets to be compiled (e.g., `dlsim`, `ulsim`, `nr_dlsim`, `nr_ulsim`, etc.).
   - The build process uses 28 parallel jobs (`-j28`).

4. **Log File Creation**: The compilation log is written to `/home/bricer/Developer/openairinterface5g/cmake_targets/log/all.txt`.

5. **Build Completion**: The listed targets are successfully compiled, and the message `BUILD SHOULD BE SUCCESSFUL` confirms that the build process was completed without errors.

Overall, the output indicates that the build process for the specified OAI physical layer simulators was configured and executed successfully.
