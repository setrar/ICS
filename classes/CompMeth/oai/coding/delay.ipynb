    "The `delay` variable in the provided code is used to store and manage the estimated delay of the received signal, which is crucial for accurate channel estimation and subsequent signal processing. This variable helps in compensating for any timing misalignment between the transmitted and received signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed analysis of how the `delay` variable is used in the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The `delay` variable is initialized to zero before the channel estimation process begins:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "delay_t *delay = &gNB->ulsch[ul_id].delay;\n",
    "memset(delay, 0, sizeof(*delay));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that any previous delay estimates are cleared, and the delay variable is ready to store new estimates for the current processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating Delay\n",
    "\n",
    "During the channel estimation process, the delay is estimated based on the received signal and the known reference signal (DMRS). This estimation typically involves calculating the cross-correlation between the received and reference signals to determine the timing offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For DMRS Type 1 with Frequency-Domain Interpolation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "nr_est_delay(gNB->frame_parms.ofdm_symbol_size, ul_ls_est, (c16_t *)pusch_vars->ul_ch_estimates_time[aarx], delay);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `nr_est_delay` is a function that estimates the delay. It uses the OFDM symbol size, the least squares channel estimates (`ul_ls_est`), and other parameters to calculate the estimated delay.\n",
    "- The result is stored in the `delay` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying Delay Compensation\n",
    "\n",
    "After estimating the delay, it is necessary to compensate for this delay in the channel estimates to correct any timing misalignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Apply Delay Compensation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int delay_idx = get_delay_idx(delay->est_delay, MAX_DELAY_COMP);\n",
    "c16_t *ul_delay_table = gNB->frame_parms.delay_table[delay_idx];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_delay_idx` is a function that converts the estimated delay into an index for accessing a delay compensation table (`ul_delay_table`).\n",
    "- `ul_delay_table` contains precomputed values for compensating different delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "for (int n = 0; n < 3 * nb_rb_pusch; n++) {\n",
    "    for (int k_line = 0; k_line <= 1; k_line++) {\n",
    "        int k = pilot_cnt << 1;\n",
    "        c16_t ch16 = c16mulShift(ul_ls_est[k], ul_delay_table[k], 8);\n",
    "        // Further processing with delay compensated channel estimate (ch16)\n",
    "        pilot_cnt++;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The channel estimates (`ul_ls_est`) are multiplied with the corresponding delay compensation values from `ul_delay_table` to obtain the delay-compensated channel estimates (`ch16`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reverting Delay Compensation\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it may be necessary to revert the delay compensation applied earlier. This is typically done by applying the inverse of the estimated delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Revert Delay Compensation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int inv_delay_idx = get_delay_idx(-delay->est_delay, MAX_DELAY_COMP);\n",
    "c16_t *ul_inv_delay_table = gNB->frame_parms.delay_table[inv_delay_idx];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The inverse delay index is calculated, and the corresponding inverse delay table (`ul_inv_delay_table`) is accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "for (int n = 0; n < 3 * nb_rb_pusch; n++) {\n",
    "    for (int k_line = 0; k_line <= 1; k_line++) {\n",
    "        int k = pilot_cnt << 1;\n",
    "        ul_ch[k] = c16mulShift(ul_ch[k], ul_inv_delay_table[k], 8);\n",
    "        ul_ch[k + 1] = c16mulShift(ul_ch[k + 1], ul_inv_delay_table[k + 1], 8);\n",
    "        // Further processing with the reverted delay compensated channel estimate\n",
    "        pilot_cnt++;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The previously delay-compensated channel estimates (`ul_ch`) are multiplied with the inverse delay compensation values from `ul_inv_delay_table` to revert the delay compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The `delay` variable is initialized to zero before starting the channel estimation process.\n",
    "2. **Delay Estimation**: The delay is estimated using the `nr_est_delay` function, which calculates the timing offset based on the received signal and known reference signal.\n",
    "3. **Applying Delay Compensation**: The estimated delay is used to access a precomputed delay compensation table (`ul_delay_table`), and the channel estimates are adjusted accordingly.\n",
    "4. **Reverting Delay Compensation**: If needed, the delay compensation can be reverted by applying the inverse of the estimated delay using an inverse delay compensation table (`ul_inv_delay_table`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `delay` variable plays a crucial role in ensuring that the timing alignment between the transmitted and received signals is accurately maintained, which is essential for reliable channel estimation and subsequent signal processing steps."

    "The function `nr_est_delay` estimates the delay in the received signal by analyzing the channel estimates in the time domain. Let's break down the function step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`int ofdm_symbol_size`**: The size of the OFDM symbol, which corresponds to the number of subcarriers.\n",
    "2. **`const c16_t *ls_est`**: Pointer to the least squares (LS) estimates of the channel in the frequency domain.\n",
    "3. **`c16_t *ch_estimates_time`**: Pointer to an array where the channel estimates in the time domain will be stored.\n",
    "4. **`delay_t *delay`**: Pointer to a structure where the delay information will be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in the Function\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Frequency to Time Domain Conversion**:\n",
    "   ```c\n",
    "   freq2time(ofdm_symbol_size, (int16_t *)ls_est, (int16_t *)ch_estimates_time);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line converts the frequency domain LS estimates (`ls_est`) to time domain channel estimates (`ch_estimates_time`) using an inverse FFT (implemented in `freq2time`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Variables for Delay Estimation**:\n",
    "   ```c\n",
    "   int max_pos = delay->delay_max_pos;\n",
    "   int max_val = delay->delay_max_val;\n",
    "   const int sync_pos = 0;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   These lines initialize `max_pos` and `max_val` with values stored in the `delay` structure. `sync_pos` is set to `0`, representing the expected synchronization position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Search for Maximum Amplitude**:\n",
    "   ```c\n",
    "   for (int i = 0; i < ofdm_symbol_size; i++) { \n",
    "     int temp = c16amp2(ch_estimates_time[i]) >> 1;\n",
    "     if (temp > max_val) {\n",
    "       max_pos = i;\n",
    "       max_val = temp;\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop iterates over the time domain channel estimates to find the position (`max_pos`) with the maximum amplitude (`max_val`). The function `c16amp2` computes the squared amplitude of the complex channel estimate. The `>> 1` operation is a right shift by one bit, effectively dividing by 2 for scaling purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adjust Position for Delay**:\n",
    "   ```c\n",
    "   if (max_pos > ofdm_symbol_size / 2)\n",
    "     max_pos = max_pos - ofdm_symbol_size;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This condition checks if the maximum position is in the second half of the OFDM symbol. If it is, it adjusts `max_pos` by subtracting `ofdm_symbol_size` to correctly represent the delay (accounting for cyclic prefix effects in OFDM).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Store Results in Delay Structure**:\n",
    "   ```c\n",
    "   delay->delay_max_pos = max_pos;\n",
    "   delay->delay_max_val = max_val;\n",
    "   delay->est_delay = max_pos - sync_pos;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   These lines update the `delay` structure with the computed maximum position (`max_pos`), the corresponding maximum value (`max_val`), and the estimated delay (`est_delay`). The `est_delay` is calculated as the difference between `max_pos` and `sync_pos`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The `nr_est_delay` function estimates the delay in the received signal by:\n",
    "1. Converting frequency domain channel estimates to time domain.\n",
    "2. Finding the position with the maximum amplitude in the time domain.\n",
    "3. Adjusting for potential cyclic prefix effects.\n",
    "4. Storing the results in a delay structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is essential in communication systems to accurately synchronize the received signal with the transmitted signal, ensuring correct demodulation and decoding."
