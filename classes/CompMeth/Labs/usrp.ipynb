    "Comparing `sc16` and `fc32` formats for USRP streamers involves looking at their numerical representation, precision, dynamic range, and bandwidth usage. Here's a compact comparison:\n",

    "| Feature         | `sc16`                                   | `fc32`                                   |\n",

    "| **Description** | Signed Complex 16-bit Integers           | Floating-point Complex 32-bit per Part   |\n",
    "| **Components**  | 16-bit signed integer real and imaginary | 32-bit floating-point real and imaginary |\n",
    "| **Precision**   | Lower (limited by integer range)         | Higher (floating-point precision)        |\n",
    "| **Dynamic Range** | Limited by the 16-bit integer (-32768 to 32767) | Wider due to the floating-point representation |\n",
    "| **Bandwidth Usage** | Lower (more compact, 4 bytes per sample) | Higher (8 bytes per sample)              |\n",
    "| **Use Case**    | Suitable for applications where bandwidth and memory usage are critical, and where the reduced dynamic range and precision are acceptable. | Preferred when higher precision and dynamic range are required for the application, at the cost of increased bandwidth and memory usage. |\n",

    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`sc16`** is more bandwidth and memory efficient, making it suitable for high-volume or limited-resource scenarios, but comes with a trade-off in terms of numerical precision and dynamic range.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`fc32`** offers better precision and dynamic range, beneficial for applications needing detailed signal analysis or high-quality signal generation, at the expense of increased data size and bandwidth requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between `sc16` and `fc32` largely depends on the specific requirements of the application, including the necessary precision, acceptable dynamic range, and available system resources."
