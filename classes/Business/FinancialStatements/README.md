When selling a company, several key financial indicators are crucial to assess the company's health, attractiveness, and value. These indicators help potential buyers understand the financial performance and potential future returns of the business. Here are some of the primary financial indicators and metrics that are typically considered important during the sale of a company:

### 1. **Revenue and Revenue Growth**
- **Revenue**: Total income generated from business operations. It’s the starting point for assessing a company's size and market position.
- **Revenue Growth**: Indicates how quickly a company's sales are increasing over time. Consistent growth is often a sign of market demand and effective management.

### 2. **Profitability Metrics**
- **Gross Profit Margin**: Measures the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold. It reflects the efficiency of production and pricing strategies.
- **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)**: Provides insight into the company's operational profitability by focusing on earnings from core business activities before the impact of financial and accounting decisions.
- **Net Profit Margin**: Shows what percentage of revenue remains as profit after all expenses. It’s essential for assessing the bottom-line efficiency.

### 3. **Liquidity Ratios**
- **Current Ratio**: Compares current assets to current liabilities, indicating the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.
- **Quick Ratio**: Similar to the current ratio but excludes inventory from assets. It’s a more stringent measure of liquidity.

### 4. **Leverage Ratios**
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Shows the proportion of equity and debt used to finance the company's assets. A lower ratio typically indicates less risk.
- **Interest Coverage Ratio**: Measures the company’s ability to make interest payments, an important consideration if the business has significant debt.

### 5. **Efficiency Ratios**
- **Asset Turnover Ratio**: Indicates how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. This is particularly important for capital-intensive industries.
- **Inventory Turnover**: Shows how often inventory is sold and replaced over a period, an essential factor for manufacturing and retail sectors.

### 6. **Cash Flow Indicators**
- **Operating Cash Flow**: Highlights the cash generated from regular business operations, indicating the company’s ability to sustain its operations financially.
- **Free Cash Flow**: Available cash that can be used to pay dividends, repay debt, or invest in growth. It’s a key indicator of financial flexibility.

### 7. **Valuation Multiples**
- **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)**: Helps gauge the market's expectations of future earnings and compare valuation with competitors.
- **Enterprise Value Multiples**: Including EV/EBITDA, which assess the value of the company including debt, providing a more comprehensive picture than just market capitalization.

### Other Considerations
- **Customer and Market Diversification**: Reliance on a small number of customers or a single market can be a risk factor.
- **Regulatory Compliance and Legal Issues**: Any ongoing or potential legal issues can affect the valuation and attractiveness of the company.

When preparing to sell a company, these financial indicators should be part of a comprehensive due diligence process. The seller should ensure that all financial statements are up-to-date, audited, and reflective of the company's true financial state. Clear and transparent financial records increase buyer confidence and can significantly influence the valuation and smooth progression of the sale process.

Yes, profit margins are typically expressed in percentage points. This convention allows for a clear and standardized understanding of how much of a company's revenue remains as profit after accounting for various costs and expenses. Expressing profit margins in percentages provides a direct way to compare profitability across different companies and industries, regardless of the size of the companies or differences in sales volumes.

Here’s a breakdown of how profit margins are commonly calculated and expressed:

1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from total revenue and then dividing the result by the total revenue. The formula is:

$$
\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \left(\frac{\text{Total Revenue} - \text{COGS}}{\text{Total Revenue}}\right) \times 100\%
$$

2. **Operating Profit Margin**: This takes into account operating expenses in addition to COGS. It is calculated by subtracting operating expenses and COGS from total revenue, and then dividing by total revenue:

$$
\text{Operating Profit Margin} = \left(\frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Total Revenue}}\right) \times 100\%
$$
   where Operating Income = Total Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses.

3. **Net Profit Margin**: This considers all expenses, including COGS, operating expenses, interest, and taxes. It is derived by dividing net profit (total revenue minus all expenses) by total revenue:

$$
\text{Net Profit Margin} = \left(\frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Total Revenue}}\right) \times 100\%
$$

Using percentage points for these calculations allows businesses and analysts to gauge the efficiency of a company's management in generating profit from sales. It also facilitates comparisons over different periods or among different companies, providing insights into the operational and financial health of a business.

Liquidity ratios are critical financial metrics used to determine a company's ability to meet its short-term debt obligations using its current or most liquid assets. They provide insight into the financial health of a business, particularly its short-term stability. Here are the formulas for the most commonly used liquidity ratios:

### 1. **Current Ratio**

The **Current Ratio** measures a company's ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. It is calculated as:

$$
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

- **Current Assets** include cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, and other assets that are expected to be liquidated or turned into cash in less than one year.
- **Current Liabilities** are obligations the company expects to pay within the coming year.

### 2. **Quick Ratio** (also known as the **Acid-Test Ratio**)

The **Quick Ratio** is a more stringent test of liquidity compared to the current ratio. It excludes inventory and other less liquid current assets as part of the available assets to cover current liabilities. It is calculated as:

$$
\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventories} - \text{Prepaid Expenses}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

or

$$
\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} + \text{Marketable Securities} + \text{Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

This ratio focuses on the most liquid assets, those that can be quickly converted to cash.

### 3. **Cash Ratio**

The **Cash Ratio** is an even more conservative measure of a company's liquidity, examining only cash and cash equivalents relative to current liabilities. It is calculated as:

$$
\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

This ratio measures the ability of a company to immediately pay off its current liabilities with cash or assets that are cash-like in their liquidity.

### Practical Importance

- **Risk Assessment**: These ratios are used by creditors and investors to assess the risk level of a company, particularly its ability to pay off short-term debts.
- **Operational Efficiency**: A high liquidity ratio might indicate good short-term financial health, but it can also suggest an inefficient use of assets. Conversely, a very low liquidity ratio might indicate financial distress or poor cash management.

These liquidity ratios provide essential insights into a company's operational efficiency and financial health, helping stakeholders make informed decisions. However, it's crucial to compare these ratios within the context of industry standards and historical company performance for accurate assessment.
