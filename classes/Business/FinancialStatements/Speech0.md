"Ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for joining today's financial overview. Letâ€™s delve into our latest quarterly figures and key financial indicators that highlight our strategic trajectory and operational efficiency.

Firstly, our retained earnings the last quarters have shown a robust increase, reflecting our solid profitability and prudent financial management. We retained up to 30 million, supporting our strategic investments and growth initiatives. Dividends paid out these quarters amounted to a close 2 million, maintaining a rewarding yield for our shareholders. Additionally, our supplier credits have increased, which was due to avoid the use of credits and juggling with cash flow transfer between regions.

Moving to our financial key indicators, our gross profit margin hopefully will remain stable at around 35%, demonstrating our ability to manage production costs effectively. Our net profit margin has seen a steady increase to remain at around 30%, indicative of our operational efficiencies and stringent cost control measures.

Concerning our liquidity ratios, the current ratio stands at a more than a healthy 500, signaling our ability to cover short-term obligations. The quick ratio, an even stricter measure, is just below the current ratio, which underscores our strong liquidity position without reliance on inventory.

Finally, comparing our projected versus actual financial metrics over the last quarters, we have consistently met or exceeded most of our financial growth. For the actual quarters, however, while our revenue projections were slightly overestimated, we managed to maintain profitability through cost savings and operational adjustments and avoid using credit.
