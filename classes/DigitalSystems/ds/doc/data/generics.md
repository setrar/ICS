Generics

---

Generics are a way to parametrize an entity/architecture pair.
The generic parameters are declared in the entity and can be used as constants everywhere else in the entity and architecture code.
They can have a default value or not and their value can be assigned when instantiating the entity inside an encapsulating design.

```vhdl
entity subcircuit is
  generic(
    size: positive := 16
  );
  port(
    a: in  std_ulogic;
    b: in  std_ulogic_vector(1 to size);
    ...
    r: out std_ulogic;
    s: out std_ulogic_vector(7 downto 4)
  );
end entity subcircuit;

architecture arc of subcircuit is
...
end architecture arc;
...
entity circuit is
  port(
    a: in  std_ulogic;
    ...
    foo: out std_ulogic_vector(3 downto 0);
    ...
  );
end entity circuit;

architecture arc of circuit is
  ...
  signal bb:  std_ulogic_vector(36 downto 0);
  ...
begin
  ...
  u0: entity work.subcircuit(arc)
    generic map(
      size => 37
    )
    port map(
      a => a,
      b => bb,
      ...
      r => open,
      s => foo
    );
  ...
end architecture arc;
```
