Market Conditions focus on OpenRAN and private network

## Macro Network

### ORAN Stack

Mixing and Matching of vendors:
Example, RU and DU

Verizon: 
- Ericsson Shop, 
- virtualized and Containerized environment throughout CU, DU and RU
- issue is performance ( propietary 7.3 vs O-RAN 7.2 protocol stack ) - 7.3 better
- do not care about standards (i.e. ETSI containerized standard)
- moving to distributed environment
- interoperability and conformance cost
- cost of ownership much higher

### DSL - Domain Specific Language

Supposedly to abstract the hardware and simulate in a much simpler way
HW takes too much time to get to market

Abstracted to software layer is more desirable

Layer 1 is much complex layer - RU & DU
Much complex interface that people are tryin to solve


Mix and match different vendors can be complicated: i.e. Asynchronous synchronisation

rAPPs

Verizon will not run on xAPPs

Open RAN Technology & Support Providers

COTS

OpenRAN - Canada TELUS


## Private Network

QoE - Quality of Experience 
QoS - Quality of Service - much less stringent than in Macro Network

- License Spectrum being auctioned only to service providers
- Europe Gov (Local Licences) is providing  spectrum to private entities

Deploy Private Netwok in small form factor

Perfect business case to compete against big Ericsson player to live in a small margin

### Hyperscalers 

Microsoft have bought  MetaSwitch 
AT&T is outsourcing in the public cloud to Microsoft - more agile
Tally up with AWS and GCP to use their compute ressources


Paradigme : vertical agnostic

### Use Cases:

Deployment Scenario: 

* Security concern in Gov Premises User X

UE and RU are all inside the building

* Hospital  User Y

Monitor the patients inside the hospital but can be connect (through the macro-network) uses the MPN function

* Using Radio to outside macro (core) network User Z

* Hybrid Private Network

  Server multiple customers in multiple verticals

Summary:

Private Network is very competitive market
Key vendors are losing their MVP 
RAN expertise is still slow not the App expertise

Prediction: Hyperscalers will buy MNOs (i.e. Microsoft -> AT&T )


Integrators vs MVNE (Mobile Virtual Network Enabler)
