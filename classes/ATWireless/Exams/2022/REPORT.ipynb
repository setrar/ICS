    "1. **SU-MIMO Capacity Achievement:**  \n",
    "   The capacity of a **Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO)** channel is achieved through **singular value decomposition (SVD)** and **water-filling power allocation** across parallel eigenmodes of the channel. When the channel is fully known at both the transmitter and receiver, the transmitter uses **beamforming** along the channel's eigenvectors to maximize the achievable data rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **MU-MIMO User Doubling and Rate:**  \n",
    "   No, doubling the number of users does **not always halve** the individual rate.  \n",
    "   - With **perfect channel state information (CSI)** and proper **precoding** (e.g., zero-forcing or MMSE), users can be spatially separated, allowing the system to maintain higher total throughput without strictly halving rates.\n",
    "   - However, if CSI or precoding is inefficient or suboptimal, interference increases, potentially reducing user rates. Thus, it depends on system conditions and precoding strategies."
