To calculate the **total yearly cost per subscriber** for 5G spectrum in France, we can estimate based on the following:

### Known Data:
1. **Total 5G Spectrum License Fees**: €2.786 billion (over 15 years, as 5G licenses in France are typically valid for 15 years).
2. **Total Subscribers**: ~76.8 million (current mobile subscriptions in France).
3. **Duration of License**: 15 years.

### Steps to Calculate Yearly Cost per Subscriber:
1. **Yearly Cost of Spectrum**:
   $\text{Yearly Cost of Spectrum} = \frac{\text{Total License Fees}}{\text{License Duration}}$
   $= \frac{2.786 \, \text{billion}}{15} = \text{€185.73 million per year}$

2. **Cost per Subscriber per Year**:
   $\text{Cost per Subscriber per Year} = \frac{\text{Yearly Cost of Spectrum}}{\text{Total Subscribers}}$
   $= \frac{185.73 \, \text{million}}{76.8 \, \text{million}} = \text{€2.42 per subscriber per year}$

### Final Result:
The **total yearly cost per subscriber** for 5G spectrum fees in France is approximately **€2.42**.  

This cost reflects only the spectrum licensing fee and does not include other operational, infrastructure, or service costs borne by operators, which also influence subscriber charges.

To estimate the **total yearly cost per subscriber** for 5G spectrum in Canada, we can analyze the available data as follows:

### 1. Total 5G Spectrum License Fees:

Canada has conducted significant 5G spectrum auctions in recent years:

- **3500 MHz Auction (2021):** Raised approximately **CAD 8.91 billion**. ([Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2021/07/3500-mhz-auction-supports-more-competition-better-coverage-and-faster-deployment-of-5g-technologies-for-canadians.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- **3800 MHz Auction (2023):** Generated over **CAD 2.1 billion**. ([IT World Canada](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/5g-spectrum-auction-concludes-bell-rogers-and-telus-bag-the-most-licenses/554405?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Combining these, the total revenue from these auctions is approximately **CAD 11.01 billion**.

### 2. License Duration:

In Canada, spectrum licenses are typically valid for **20 years**. ([Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2021/07/3500-mhz-auction--process-and-results.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 3. Total Mobile Subscribers:

As of the second quarter of 2024, Canada had approximately **36.7 million mobile subscribers**. ([Canadian Telecommunications Association](https://canadatelecoms.ca/industry_data/mobile-phone-subscriptions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### Calculation:

1. **Annual Spectrum Cost:**

   $\text{Annual Spectrum Cost} = \frac{\text{Total License Fees}}{\text{License Duration}}$

   $= \frac{11{,}010{,}000{,}000 \, \text{CAD}}{20 \, \text{years}} = 550{,}500{,}000 \, \text{CAD/year}$

2. **Annual Cost per Subscriber:**

   $\text{Annual Cost per Subscriber} = \frac{\text{Annual Spectrum Cost}}{\text{Total Subscribers}}$

   $= \frac{550{,}500{,}000 \, \text{CAD/year}}{36{,}700{,}000 \, \text{subscribers}} \approx 15 \, \text{CAD/subscriber/year}$

### Conclusion:

The estimated **annual spectrum license cost per mobile subscriber** in Canada is approximately **15 CAD**.

**Note:** This calculation focuses solely on the spectrum license fees and does not account for other operational expenses, infrastructure investments, or additional costs incurred by mobile operators, which also influence the pricing of services to consumers.

The higher cost of 5G spectrum in Canada compared to France is due to:

1. **Aggressive Spectrum Auctions**: Canada uses revenue-maximizing auctions, driving up prices, while France's ARCEP focuses on affordability.
2. **Market Concentration**: Canada has 3 dominant players (Bell, Rogers, Telus), leading to less competition. France has 4 major operators, increasing competition and lowering costs.
3. **Population Density**: Canada’s sparse population (4/km²) raises deployment costs, while France’s higher density (123/km²) spreads costs across more users.
4. **Geographic Challenges**: Canada’s vast size and rural areas require costly infrastructure. France’s smaller, more uniform geography is cheaper to serve.
5. **Regulatory Priorities**: Canada prioritizes government revenue and rural coverage, while France emphasizes affordability and competition.

In short, Canada's unique geography, market structure, and auction policies make spectrum and deployment costs significantly higher.
