Introduction

Pre-requisites

We represent objects as vectors/matrices (arrays of numbers),

so we have to do maths.

Being familiar with calculus (integration, differentiation ...)

Good understanding of probabilities

Good understanding of linear algebra

Today we will do a brief recap of these math subjects.
