    "The term you're referring to is **Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS)**. CBRS is a 150 MHz wide broadcast band in the 3.5 GHz spectrum (3550 MHz to 3700 MHz) in the United States. This band was previously reserved for military use but has been repurposed to allow shared access among federal and non-federal users, including private companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established rules for commercial use of this band in 2017, enabling wireless carriers to deploy 5G networks without acquiring traditional spectrum licenses. This initiative aims to promote more efficient use of the spectrum and foster innovation in wireless services. \n",
    "\n",
    "CBRS operates under a three-tiered spectrum sharing framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Incumbent Access**: Reserved for existing federal users, primarily the U.S. Navy, which retains priority access.\n",
    "2. **Priority Access License (PAL)**: Licenses auctioned to commercial users for exclusive use in specific geographic areas.\n",
    "3. **General Authorized Access (GAA)**: Open to the public for unlicensed use, provided it doesn't interfere with higher-tier users.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure ensures that the spectrum is utilized efficiently while protecting incumbent military operations. \n",

    "## New Radio-Unlicensed\n",
    "\n",
    "**NR-U Coexistence** refers to the mechanisms and strategies used to enable **5G New Radio-Unlicensed (NR-U)** technology to coexist with other technologies, such as Wi-Fi, that also operate in unlicensed spectrum bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "NR-U is part of the 3GPP standardization efforts for 5G, designed to extend the capabilities of 5G into unlicensed frequency bands like **5 GHz** and **6 GHz**. Since these bands are shared with other technologies, coexistence mechanisms are critical to prevent interference and ensure fair and efficient use of the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts of NR-U Coexistence**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unlicensed Spectrum Usage**:\n",
    "   - NR-U allows 5G to operate in bands not exclusively licensed for mobile network operators.\n",
    "   - Examples include the **5 GHz** (U-NII bands) and **6 GHz** (Wi-Fi 6E) bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shared Spectrum Access**:\n",
    "   - Devices and networks operating in unlicensed bands must use coexistence mechanisms to avoid disrupting each other.\n",
    "   - Common coexisting technologies: **Wi-Fi, NR-U, LTE-U, and LAA (Licensed Assisted Access).**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regulatory Requirements**:\n",
    "   - Unlicensed spectrum use is subject to regulatory constraints that mandate coexistence.\n",
    "   - For example, regions like the EU require **Listen Before Talk (LBT)**, which ensures a device senses the channel before transmitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fairness and Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - NR-U incorporates mechanisms to maintain fairness among technologies like Wi-Fi and NR-U to share spectrum without one dominating the other.\n",
    "   - Techniques like time-sharing and dynamic frequency selection are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **NR-U Coexistence Mechanisms**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Listen Before Talk (LBT)**:\n",
    "   - Before transmitting, devices check the spectrum to ensure it is free.\n",
    "   - If the channel is busy, the device waits for a random backoff time before retrying.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Channel Access Priority Classes**:\n",
    "   - Different traffic types are assigned different priorities.\n",
    "   - High-priority traffic (e.g., real-time voice/video) gets quicker access to the channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adaptive Duty Cycling**:\n",
    "   - Adjusts transmission and idle times to balance usage among technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS)**:\n",
    "   - Ensures devices avoid radar and other high-priority services that may operate in the same band.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Power Control**:\n",
    "   - Limits transmission power to reduce interference in shared spectrum environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Spectrum Aggregation**:\n",
    "   - Combines licensed and unlicensed spectrum to improve capacity while ensuring compatibility.\n",

    "   - Used where spectrum availability is limited.\n",
