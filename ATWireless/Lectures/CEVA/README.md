## **OFDM** and **OFDMA**

The primary difference between **OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)** and **OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)** lies in how the available resources (subcarriers) are allocated and used:

---

### **1. Definition**
- **OFDM**:
  - A modulation scheme where the entire bandwidth is divided into multiple orthogonal subcarriers.
  - All subcarriers are used by a **single user** at a time.
- **OFDMA**:
  - A multiple access technique that extends OFDM by allowing multiple users to share the subcarriers.
  - Subcarriers are dynamically divided among multiple users simultaneously.

---

### **2. User Access**
- **OFDM**:
  - Designed for **single-user** communication.
  - All subcarriers are utilized for one user at a time.
- **OFDMA**:
  - Designed for **multi-user** communication.
  - Subcarriers are allocated to different users, enabling simultaneous access.

---

### **3. Resource Allocation**
- **OFDM**:
  - No dynamic resource allocation; the entire frequency band is used by one user.
- **OFDMA**:
  - Supports dynamic allocation of subcarriers, time slots, and power to different users based on their requirements.

---

### **4. Applications**
- **OFDM**:
  - Primarily used in point-to-point communication systems such as:
    - Wi-Fi (802.11a/g/n/ac).
    - Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB-T, DVB-C).
- **OFDMA**:
  - Primarily used in point-to-multipoint systems such as:
    - 4G LTE.
    - 5G NR.
    - Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax).

---

### **5. Latency**
- **OFDM**:
  - Higher latency for multi-user scenarios as each user must take turns using the entire bandwidth.
- **OFDMA**:
  - Lower latency since multiple users can transmit simultaneously on separate subcarriers.

---

### **6. Complexity**
- **OFDM**:
  - Less complex, as it deals with one user and all subcarriers.
- **OFDMA**:
  - More complex due to the need for dynamic resource allocation, synchronization, and interference management among multiple users.

---

### **7. Efficiency**
- **OFDM**:
  - Less efficient in multi-user environments because only one user can use the resources at a time.
- **OFDMA**:
  - More efficient in multi-user environments because it enables simultaneous access for multiple users.

| **Complexity**          | Lower                       | Higher                        |

---

### **Summary**
- **OFDM** is a **modulation technique** designed for single-user systems, where all subcarriers are dedicated to one user.
- **OFDMA** is a **multiple access technique** that builds on OFDM, enabling efficient resource sharing among multiple users in modern communication systems like **4G LTE**, **5G**, and **Wi-Fi 6**.

## **coding rate**

The **coding rate** is the ratio of useful data to total transmitted data, expressed as $R = \frac{k}{n}$, where $k$ is the number of information bits and $n$ is the total bits (information + redundancy). 

### **Wi-Fi 6 Coding Rates**:
- Coding rates vary based on the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS):
  - $\frac{1}{2}$: High redundancy, robust (e.g., BPSK, QPSK).
  - $\frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{6}$: Less redundancy, high throughput (e.g., 64-QAM, 1024-QAM).

### **Trade-offs**:
- **Higher Coding Rate (e.g., $\frac{5}{6}$)**: Faster data, less error protection, needs good channel conditions.
- **Lower Coding Rate (e.g., $\frac{1}{2}$)**: Slower data, better error correction, suitable for poor conditions.

Wi-Fi 6 dynamically adapts the coding rate based on channel quality for optimal performance.

## **Coherence time** (used for BeamForming)

**Coherence time** is the time duration over which a wireless communication channel can be considered time-invariant or stable, meaning the channel's characteristics (such as amplitude and phase) remain relatively constant. It is a key parameter in wireless communication systems for assessing channel variability due to motion or changing environments.

---

### **Definition**
Coherence time ($T_c$) is inversely related to the **Doppler spread** ($f_D$), which is caused by relative motion between the transmitter and receiver or changes in the environment:

$T_c \approx \frac{1}{f_D}$

Where:
- $T_c$: Coherence time (seconds).
- $f_D$: Doppler spread (Hz), the range of frequency shifts caused by motion.

---

### **Key Factors Affecting Coherence Time**
1. **Relative Speed**:
   - Higher relative speed between transmitter and receiver â†’ Higher Doppler spread â†’ Shorter coherence time.
2. **Carrier Frequency**:
   - Higher frequencies are more affected by Doppler shift â†’ Shorter coherence time.
3. **Environment**:
   - Urban environments with multipath propagation typically result in shorter coherence times due to rapid signal fluctuations.

---

### **Implications**
- **Fast Fading**:
   - Occurs when $T_c$ is very short, and the channel changes rapidly compared to the signal's symbol duration.
   - Communication systems need to adapt dynamically, e.g., using equalization or error correction.
- **Slow Fading**:
   - Occurs when $T_c$ is long, and the channel remains relatively stable over many symbols.

---

### **Rule of Thumb**
- Coherence time is typically approximated as:

$T_c \approx \frac{0.423}{f_D}$

Where $f_D = v \cdot \frac{f_c}{c}$:
- $v$: Relative speed (m/s).
- $f_c$: Carrier frequency (Hz).
- $c$: Speed of light ($3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$).

---

### **Applications**
- **Design of Communication Systems**:
   - Adaptive modulation and coding.
   - Channel estimation and tracking.
   - Time diversity techniques.
- **5G and Beyond**:
   - Essential for systems operating at higher frequencies (e.g., mmWave) where $T_c$ is shorter.

---

### **Example**
- At $f_c = 2 \, \text{GHz}$ with $v = 30 \, \text{m/s}$ (108 km/h):
  - $f_D = v \cdot \frac{f_c}{c} = 30 \cdot \frac{2 \times 10^9}{3 \times 10^8} = 200 \, \text{Hz}$
  - $T_c \approx \frac{0.423}{200} \approx 2.1 \, \text{ms}$

This means the channel will remain stable for approximately 2.1 milliseconds.

---

### **Summary**
Coherence time quantifies how long a channel remains stable. Shorter $T_c$ (high motion, high frequency) requires faster channel adaptation, while longer $T_c$ allows for simpler communication strategies.

## **Coherence bandwidth**

**Coherence bandwidth ($B_c$)** is the frequency range over which the channel's response remains constant. It is inversely related to the **delay spread ($\tau$)**:

$B_c \approx \frac{1}{\tau}$

---

### **Key Points**:
- **Flat fading**: Signal bandwidth $W \leq B_c$ â†’ Channel behaves uniformly across frequencies.
- **Frequency-selective fading**: Signal bandwidth $W > B_c$ â†’ Channel varies across frequencies.
- Used to design systems like **OFDM** by ensuring subcarrier spacing fits within $B_c$.

---

### **Examples**:
- Indoor ($\tau \sim 1 \, \mu s$): $B_c \approx 1 \, \text{MHz}$.
- Urban ($\tau \sim 10 \, \mu s$): $B_c \approx 100 \, \text{kHz}$.

---

### **Comparison with Coherence Time**:
| **Aspect**           | **Coherence Bandwidth**    | **Coherence Time**         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Depends on**        | Delay spread ($\tau$)    | Doppler spread ($f_D$)   |
| **Unit**             | Hertz (Hz)                | Seconds (s)               |
| **Applications**     | Frequency stability       | Time stability            |

### **Purpose**:
Helps design systems for stable signal transmission in multipath environments.

The **relationship between degrees of freedom (DoF)** and the **number of nulls** lies in how the available DoF can be allocated to either **enhance the signal** in desired directions or **cancel the signal** in undesired ones. Here's the key insight:

---

## **Degree of Freedom**

### **Relationship Between Degrees of Freedom and Nulls**
- The **number of nulls** that can be formed is equal to:
  $
  \text{Number of Nulls} = \text{Degrees of Freedom (DoF)} - 1
  $
- This relationship holds because:
  - One degree of freedom is always used to form the **main beam** (the desired signal direction).
  - The remaining DoF can be used to create nulls to cancel interference or jamming signals in undesired directions.

---

### **Key Points**
1. **Degrees of Freedom (DoF)**:
   - Determined by the number of antennas (\(N\)) in a system.
   - $\text{DoF} = N$ for a single antenna array.
   - $\text{DoF} = \min(N_t, N_r)$ for MIMO systems (\(N_t\): Transmitter antennas, \(N_r\): Receiver antennas).

2. **Null Formation**:
   - Each null requires one degree of freedom.
   - With \(N\) antennas, you can form \(N-1\) nulls.

---

### **Example**
- **8 Antennas**:
  - Degrees of Freedom = $8$.
  - Main Beam = 1 DoF.
  - Remaining $8 - 1 = 7$ DoF can be used to create nulls.
  - Thus, **7 nulls** can be formed.

---

### **Trade-offs**
- **Beamforming vs. Nulling**:
  - More DoF spent on nulling leaves fewer DoF for improving the main beam (e.g., increasing gain or shaping the beam).
- **Spatial Multiplexing vs. Nulling**:
  - In multi-user MIMO, some DoF may be allocated to serve multiple users, reducing the number of nulls that can be formed.

---

### **Practical Applications**
1. **Interference Mitigation**:
   - Use nulls to cancel interference from specific directions.
2. **Multi-User MIMO**:
   - Balance DoF between serving multiple users and nulling interference.
3. **Beamforming Optimization**:
   - Adjust nulls and beam direction to maximize signal quality for the intended user while minimizing interference.

---

### **Summary**
The **number of nulls** is directly related to the **degrees of freedom** by the formula $\text{Nulls} = \text{DoF} - 1$. With \(N\) antennas, you can form one main beam and up to \(N-1\) nulls, providing flexibility in signal optimization and interference management.
