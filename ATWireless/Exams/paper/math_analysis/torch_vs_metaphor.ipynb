    "The **projector metaphor** enhances and generalizes the **torch metaphor** by addressing its limitations and providing a more complete framework for analyzing the performance tradeoffs in **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)** systems. Here’s how the two metaphors relate and what the projector metaphor adds:\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Torch Metaphor**\n",
    "1. **Core Idea**:\n",
    "   - The torch metaphor compares the signal used in ISAC to a beam of light (a torch), where:\n",
    "     - The **beam’s width** represents the energy spread.\n",
    "     - The **beam’s intensity** reflects how concentrated the signal energy is in a specific direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Application**:\n",
    "   - The torch metaphor helps explain the tradeoff between sensing and communication:\n",
    "     - A **narrow beam** concentrates energy for precise sensing.\n",
    "     - A **wide beam** distributes energy for robust communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limitations**:\n",
    "   - **Simplistic View**: Focuses primarily on spatial energy distribution, ignoring the **statistical properties** or structure of the signal.\n",
    "   - **Restricted Scope**: Mainly applies to spatial beamforming or energy tradeoffs but doesn’t generalize to all sensing or communication tasks (e.g., statistical estimation and detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Projector Metaphor**\n",
    "The projector metaphor expands on the torch metaphor by introducing a more **mathematically grounded framework** that incorporates both the **spatial and statistical properties** of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key Additions**:\n",
    "   - **Empirical Distribution**:\n",
    "     - While the torch metaphor only considers energy distribution, the projector metaphor incorporates the **statistical structure** (type) of the signal, such as its deterministic and random components.\n",
    "     - Example: The projector metaphor explains how the signal $ X $ is projected into deterministic (sensing) and random (communication) subspaces, balancing the tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Generalized Framework**:\n",
    "     - The projector metaphor applies to both estimation and detection tasks, not just spatial energy allocation.\n",
    "     - It allows for the analysis of **performance metrics** like the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB), detection probability ($P_D$), and spectral efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Signal Decomposition**:\n",
    "     - The metaphor visualizes how the signal $ X $ is split into components:\n",
    "       $\n",
    "       X = P_d X + P_r X\n",
    "       $\n",
    "       - $ P_d X $: Signal projected onto the deterministic subspace for sensing.\n",
    "       - $ P_r X $: Signal projected onto the random subspace for communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advantages Over the Torch Metaphor**:\n",
    "   - **Mathematical Rigor**: It integrates tools like Fisher Information, subspace projections, and optimization to provide a more rigorous understanding of the ISAC tradeoffs.\n",
    "   - **Beyond Beamforming**: While the torch metaphor is mainly about beamforming, the projector metaphor accounts for statistical properties, making it applicable to a wider range of ISAC scenarios.\n",

    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "The projector metaphor builds on the torch metaphor by expanding its focus from spatial energy distribution to a comprehensive framework that includes statistical signal properties, performance metrics, and generalized sensing-communication tradeoffs. This makes it a more versatile and rigorous tool for understanding and optimizing ISAC systems."
