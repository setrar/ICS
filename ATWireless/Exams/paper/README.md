## Abstract

The document titled “From Torch to Projector: Fundamental Tradeoff of Integrated Sensing and Communications” delves into the evolving paradigm of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC), a key component in the development of 6G wireless networks. Historically, sensing and communication systems were developed separately. However, recent advancements have led to their integration, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the inherent trade-offs between these dual functionalities.

The authors introduce the “torch metaphor” to illustrate the resource competition between sensing and communication tasks. They further expand on this by discussing the capacity-distortion (C-D) theory, highlighting its limitations in fully capturing the complexities of ISAC systems. To address these complexities, the paper presents the “projector metaphor,” which offers a more nuanced perspective on the interplay between sensing and communication.

Additionally, the study examines the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)-rate region, providing insights into the performance boundaries of ISAC systems. Practical design examples are also discussed, demonstrating the application of theoretical findings to real-world scenarios. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges in the field, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize the integration of sensing and communication functionalities.

## Dividing the paper among three individuals

Dividing the paper among three individuals depends on its structure and the main sections. Typically, research papers in IEEE journals have a clear structure that can be split into logical parts. Here's a suggested approach for dividing the work:

---

### **1. Understanding the Introduction and Problem Setup**
**Responsibilities:**
- One person focuses on the **introduction**, **motivation**, and **problem statement**.
- Tasks:
  - Summarize the background and motivation for ISAC (Integrated Sensing and Communication).
  - Highlight the "torch" and "projector" metaphors.
  - Extract the objectives and research questions posed in the paper.
- Deliverable: A summary explaining the paper's purpose, key metaphors, and theoretical setup.

---

### **2. Theoretical Foundations and Tradeoff Analysis**
**Responsibilities:**
- The second individual studies the **theoretical analysis**, including:
  - Capacity-distortion (C-D) theory and its limitations.
  - The development of the projector metaphor.
  - Analysis of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)-rate region.
- Tasks:
  - Focus on understanding the mathematical models and tradeoff frameworks.
  - Prepare a detailed breakdown of equations and figures related to the tradeoff analysis.
- Deliverable: A presentation or summary of the key theoretical contributions and insights.

### **3. Practical Design and Open Challenges**
**Responsibilities:**
- The third person handles the **practical implementation examples** and **future research directions**:
  - Discussion of the ISAC system design methodologies.
  - Applications of the projector metaphor to practical cases.
  - Highlighting open challenges and potential research extensions.
- Tasks:
  - Explain real-world implications and examples given in the paper.
  - Summarize the conclusion and future work sections.

---

### **Collaboration**
- Regularly update each other on progress and clarify any overlapping concepts.
- Collaborate on a shared glossary of terms or foundational concepts to ensure consistent understanding across sections.

This structure ensures that each individual focuses on a distinct but complementary part of the paper, promoting a comprehensive understanding of its content.
